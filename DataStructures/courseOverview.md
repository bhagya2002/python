## Why Data Structures?

### **Data Stuctures**

- menthod to store information
- efficient for storing and retrieving information
- arraging information in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate

- **Linear Data Structures**
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists

- **Non-Linear Data Structures**
- Trees, Heaps
- Graphs

### **Algorithms**

- used for procesessing data
- set of instructions
- execture in a finite amount of time

- **Analysis of Algorithms**
- time and amount of resources required to execute an algorithm
- predict performance of an algorithm
- mechanism to compare

### **Abstract Data Types (ADT)**

-types of data stored

- operations supported on the data
- representation of collections of data (amount of data, time to access, etc)
- operations performed on data (manipulate it)
