# numebrs
# int -> whole numbers
# floats -> decimal numbers are accepted
# abs(x) -> takes the absolute value of the number
# int(x) -> converts x into a integer
# float(x) -> converts x into a floating point
# str(x) -> converts x into a string

# "//" -> floor division (round down)
# "%" -> modulo (take the remainder of the divison)
# "**" -> exponential

# printing numbers, just tpye the numebr in the Print()
print(5)
print(68.45)
print(-2.345)

# also can do addition or any other math operation
print(3 + 4.5) # 7.5
print(4 * 5) # 20

# order of operation
print(4 * 5 + 3) # 23
print(4 * (5+3)) # 32

# modulus -> takes the first num and divides by the second spits out the remainder
print(10 % 3) # 1

my_num  = -5
print(my_num)

# converting a number to a string
print(str(my_num) + " my favourite number!") # you have to use two strings, CANNOT concatinate a number w/ a string

# absolute value
print(abs(my_num))

# power -> takes the first number raised to the power of the second number
print(pow(my_num, 2))

# max number
print(max(4, 6)) # take the bigger of the two numbers
# min number
print(min(4, 6)) # take the smaller of the two numbers
